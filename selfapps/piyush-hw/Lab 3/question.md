# Mini Project:
Simple To-Do Manager Using Functional Programming
Objective: Manage a list of to-do tasks using functions, lambda, filter, and map.
Requirements:
● Allow adding tasks using a function add_task(task_list, task_name).
● Each task is a dictionary: { "name": str, "completed": bool }.
● Use lambda and filter() to list only incomplete tasks.
● Use map() to mark all tasks as completed.
● Include a search_tasks(task_list, keyword) function using filter() and lambda.
